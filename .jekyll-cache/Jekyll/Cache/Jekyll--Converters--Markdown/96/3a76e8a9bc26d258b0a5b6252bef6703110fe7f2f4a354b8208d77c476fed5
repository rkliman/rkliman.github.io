<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m a Masters student studying <strong class="text-primary">Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong> at <strong class="text-warning">Georgia Tech</strong>. I have a strong interest in robotics with a specialty in control systems design. Other interests include embedded systems and micro-controller applications as well as the application of cognitive science to help improve robotic systems. I am also a deep believer in sustainability and climate action. Much of my work and research is into how robotics can be used to help solve the climate issues that will present themselves over the next few decades. Specifically, Iâ€™m interested in how robotics can be applied in the agriculture field to create decentralized and automated growing systems that can be built in developing areas and food deserts around the world.</p>

<h2 id="why-robotics">Why Robotics?</h2>

<p>Robotics is quickly becoming one of the most important and emergent fields in industry, reaching further into the supply chain and revolutionizing transportation. Additionally, robotic technologies are improving at an exponential rate each year. This growth also means that their capabilities are being used to take away more jobs every year. Robots are currently used in industry to help with manufacturing and warehouse efficiency improvement. However, they have a huge ability to help out in the domestic and home industries. This includes industries like hospice care and home assistance.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>

<p>I have a variety of hobbies that include electronics, hobby robotics, stoneworking and sculpture, and tabletop roleplaying games.</p>
