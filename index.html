    <hr>
    <div class="subsect">
      I'm a <strong>3rd year Computer Engineering Major</strong> at <strong class="text-warning">Georgia Tech</strong>. I have a strong interest in robotics with a specialty in control systems design. Other interests include embedded systems and microcontroller applications as well as the application of congitive science to help improve robotic systems.

      <h4>Why Robotics?</h4>
      In the future, I would like to be able to be part of a team of robotics pioneers. Robotics will become one of the most important and emergent fields over the next 10-20 years.Additionally, robotic technologies are improving at an exponential rate each year. This growth also means that their capabilities are being used to take away more jobs every year. By moving into the robotics field, I am theoretically giving myself an element of job security. My main goals in the robotics field is to help advance the anthropomorphic robot field. Robots are currently used in industry to help with manufacturing and warehouse efficiency improvement. However, they have a huge ability to help out in the domestic and home industries. This includes industries like hospice care and home assistance. Mostly, I think that robots can play a huge role in freeing people from menial jobs which do not let them explore their full potential. Looking forward, I want to learn a lot more about the robotics field and aim to complete a masters in ECE/Robotics. Specifically in my career, I want to work to develop robots that can perform verycomplex and difficult tasks that humans can do as well as tasks that humans struggle to do.
